CSS style sheets for web development.
This is a WIP. We just relesed the second prerelease version!
Our Homepage is <a href="https://leia286.github.io/CSS-Home.html">here</a>
<hr>
Stylesheets:<br>
1. StarWars.css This .css file is a simple file to help with formatting Star Wars styled opening crawls.
<br>
2. Sans-serif.css This makes all text be sans-serif unless overided manually.
<br>
3. Night1.css This is used on the homepage for this repo, and is a black and white basic style dependent on Bootstrap if you want it to look like the homepage without writing extra code.
<br>
4. Day1.css A day version of Night1.css, it uses warmer colors in the stylesheet.
